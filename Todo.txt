TODO:

HIGH PRIORITY: Restructure everything to follow best Design Principles and add comments to it.
(executor returns and simple string, but we would like to have it return a data structure which
gives more information so that it becomes to integrate AOF easily)
(the executor code should change a lot like creating interface for the commands)
(AOF should be within persistence/recovery strategy because there are multiple strategies that we might use...
So create an interface for strategy ) ** LOW PRIORITY ** 


persistence
AOF file
